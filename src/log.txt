2022-xi-13: added link to detail page; unable to dx from h2 to mysql
2022-xi-14: remade project and changed from h2 to mysql; needed start mamp, config password and auth, and to create a db before the program would run
2022-xi-15: got project list page (formally to-do list) working - lesson from here: always go to the line indicated in the error
changed list type for item list. Now list of posts is clickable and takes user to detail page
2022-xi-16: added editing functionality with dateModified auto-update; added deletion functionality
2022-xi-17: fixed delete button fx; attempted to add-child-item fx but parent_post_id is not taking values from the program
possible solution: look into fixing the name of the column - maybe add @Column(name=... or dx something in the meth
on button press add-child-item => 404 not found
removed th:action="/add-child-item" and method started working
